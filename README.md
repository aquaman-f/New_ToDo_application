This is a school project to prototype a to-do app. 

It was coded during 4 afternoons, presented and no further changes were made. 

All changes can be done by group members by copying the original and saving to their own machines or accounts.

The following steps to take would be: 
- to add an additional information part to include eg a shopping list to the to-do task.
- add an auto-save function
- increase accessability..
